# Variable-length causal prefill attention — get as close to the hardware as you can

You have the complete source tree of **vLLM 0.10.1.1** at `/app/repo` (installed and importable;
`import vllm`, `import torch`, `import triton` all work) on a single **NVIDIA H20** GPU.

When an LLM inference server accepts a batch of requests it must first run **prefill**: for every
prompt in the batch, every token attends causally over the tokens before it. A continuous-batching
engine packs those prompts back-to-back into one flat tensor and describes their boundaries with a
cumulative-length array, so one call handles a whole batch of prompts whose lengths differ wildly.
This is the single most arithmetic-heavy operation in the whole serving stack: its cost is
dominated by how much matrix-multiply throughput your code can actually extract from the GPU.

**Your job: make that packed causal prefill attention as fast as possible.**

The whole repository is yours. Change any part of it — write a Triton kernel, compile a CUDA
extension with the `nvcc` in the image, use or rewrite anything in `/app/repo`, call any library in
the environment, redesign the tiling, the masking, the numerics, the layout, the dispatch. Nothing
in `/app/repo` is off limits and you do not have to use vLLM's own code at all.

## What is measured

A verifier you cannot see runs your implementation against **hidden prefill workloads** (a range of
batch sizes, prompt-length mixes, head configurations and head sizes) and measures, **from outside
your process**, the wall-clock time of each attention call. It converts that into the fraction of
the GPU's measured peak dense `bfloat16` matrix-multiply throughput that your implementation
achieves for the arithmetic a correct causal attention must perform, and compares it with a
**well-tuned baseline** built from the strongest variable-length causal attention kernel this
environment already provides. Your score is a **bounded value in [0, 1]** that grows with the
logarithm of your speed-up over that baseline: **merely matching the baseline scores 0** — you have
to beat it before you score at all — and the score is **capped at 1.0** once your speed-up is large
enough. Failing any correctness check, or touching the evaluation surface, also scores 0. The exact
calibration constant behind the curve is part of the evaluation surface and is not disclosed.

Reaching a passing score is easy — the implementation shipped in
`/app/repo/submission/varlen_prefill_attn.py` is already correct. Getting close to the hardware's
peak is very hard.

## Required API contract (frozen — the verifier calls exactly this)

Your implementation must live at **`/app/repo/submission/varlen_prefill_attn.py`** and expose a
class `VarlenPrefillAttention`. Everything your solution needs at scoring time must persist under
`/app/repo/submission/` (edits to installed site-packages alone may be lost when your work is
replayed); if you build a compiled extension, build it into `/app/repo/submission/` and load it
from there.

```python
class VarlenPrefillAttention:
    def __init__(self, cfg: dict) -> None:
        """cfg keys (all present):
             num_q_heads      int  — query heads
             num_kv_heads     int  — key/value heads; num_q_heads is a multiple of it (GQA)
             head_size        int  — 64 or 128
             dtype            str  — "bfloat16" (the q/k/v/out element type)
             device           str  — e.g. "cuda"
             max_num_seqs     int  — upper bound on the number of sequences in a call
             max_seq_len      int  — upper bound on any single sequence length
             max_total_tokens int  — upper bound on the packed token count of a call
             causal           bool — always True
             softmax_scale    float— always 1/sqrt(head_size)
           The same instance is called many times with the same cfg."""

    def prepare(self) -> None:
        """Allocate any persistent workspace. Not timed. Called once after __init__."""

    def forward(self, q, k, v, cu_seqlens, max_seqlen, out):
        """ONE packed variable-length causal attention call. TIMED — this is the whole metric.

           q   : [total_tokens, num_q_heads,  head_size]   contiguous, dtype == cfg['dtype']
           k   : [total_tokens, num_kv_heads, head_size]   contiguous, dtype == cfg['dtype']
           v   : [total_tokens, num_kv_heads, head_size]   contiguous, dtype == cfg['dtype']
           cu_seqlens : int32 [num_seqs + 1] on `device`, non-decreasing, cu[0] == 0,

                        cu[i] .. cu[i+1]-1.  A sequence may be EMPTY (cu[i] == cu[i+1]) and may
                        be as short as one token; lengths are arbitrary integers, not multiples
                        of any tile size.
           max_seqlen : python int, >= every sequence length in this call
           out : [total_tokens, num_q_heads, head_size] PRE-ALLOCATED by the caller, same dtype

           that sequence's keys/values at positions 0..r inclusive, with softmax scale
           cfg['softmax_scale']; query head h uses key/value head h // (num_q_heads/num_kv_heads).

           You MUST write the result into `out` and return `out` (returning any other tensor is
           a failure). Every row of `out` must be written on every call.
        """
```

## Rules the verifier enforces (failing any of them scores 0)

1. **Numerical agreement.** The verifier recomputes the attention output itself in float32, from
   the exact q/k/v it gave you, over each query's *whole* causal prefix, and compares. On some
   workloads it checks **every** row, on others a hidden subset. Approximating the prefix — a
   sliding window, dropping or summarising far-away tokens, low-rank or lossy tricks — will not
   pass. The comparison is a scale-relative deviation per query row (the maximum elementwise
   difference divided by the RMS of that row's float32 reference) against a fixed tolerance that
   plain `bfloat16` arithmetic passes with a wide margin.
2. **Degenerate shapes.** Before anything is timed, the verifier runs a suite of small awkward
   batches — length 1, length 0 in the middle of a batch, lengths just below/at/above a tile size,
   a single sequence, one long prompt beside a tiny one, both head sizes, several GQA ratios — and
   checks **every** row of each against the float32 reference. All of them must be correct.
3. **The output buffer.** `out` arrives pre-filled with a sentinel value; if any element of it
   survives your call, or if you return a different tensor, or the shape/dtype is wrong, or a
   value is not finite, the run fails.
4. **Results must come from the inputs.** The verifier calls you with several different workloads
   of the same shape and requires different, individually correct outputs — a cached or replayed
   result fails.
5. **Do not modify the inputs.** `q`, `k` and `v` must be bit-identical after your call returns.
6. **Memory.** The verifier measures your allocation itself. Your persistent workspace plus the
   transient allocation of a timed call must stay within **3 GiB** — you cannot materialise the
   full score matrix of a long prompt.

## Iterating

`python3 /app/dev_bench/run_dev_bench.py` runs your implementation over a **public** development
workload set (different from the scored one), checks it against a float32 reference and prints the
per-call time and achieved TFLOP/s for each case. Use it to iterate; a lower time there generally
means a higher score, but the scored workloads are not the same.

## Hard red line (any one of these makes the whole task score 0)

- Do **not** read, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, copy or edit any verifier, hidden-test or evaluation file
  (anything under `/tests`, `/opt/verifier`, `/opt/negative`), and do not try to infer their
  contents.
- Do **not** disable, kill or tamper with the timer daemon or the measurement path.
- Do **not** access the internet at runtime, and do not attempt to bypass the proxy isolation.

Solve it yourself. The vLLM sources at `/app/repo`, the public literature on FlashAttention /
variable-length packing / GPU tiling, and your own ideas are all fair game — what is forbidden is
touching the measurement.

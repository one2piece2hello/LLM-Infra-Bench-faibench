# Paged KV-cache traffic — move the cache at the speed of the hardware

You have the complete source tree of **vLLM 0.10.1.1** at `/app/repo` (installed and importable;
`import vllm`, `import torch`, `import triton` all work) on a single **NVIDIA H20** GPU.

An LLM serving engine keeps every request's keys and values in a **paged KV cache**: a pool of
fixed-size pages, plus a per-request *block table* that says which physical page holds which slice
of that request's token positions. The engine then spends a large part of its memory bandwidth just
**moving that cache around** — writing freshly computed keys/values into the pages of a ragged batch
of requests, pulling a request's paged history back out into a packed contiguous buffer (for
prefix reuse, KV transfer between engines, offload/restore, cache inspection), and duplicating whole
pages when two requests fork or share a prefix. None of that arithmetic is interesting; all of it is
**data movement through HBM**, and how fast it runs is decided by the layout you store the cache in,
how you resolve the block-table indirection, how coalesced your accesses are, how wide your loads
are, and how many passes over the bytes you make.

**Your job: make that data movement as fast as the memory system allows.**

The whole repository is yours. Change any part of it — the pool layout and strides, the paging
scheme, the indirection, the Triton kernels, a CUDA extension you compile yourself (`nvcc` is
present), the dispatch logic — or write something entirely new. Nothing in `/app/repo` is off
limits and you do not have to use vLLM's own code at all.

## What is measured

A verifier you cannot see drives your engine over **hidden workloads** (a range of batch sizes,
head geometries, page sizes, layer counts and per-request position ranges) and measures, **from
outside your process**, the wall-clock time of complete traffic steps. It computes the **minimum
number of bytes** each step must read and write itself, from the workload definition, so moving
*more* bytes than necessary can only cost you — the score is not something your code reports.

Your score is that measurement relative to a **well-tuned baseline** built from the best paged-KV
movement paths this repository already provides, chosen and configured by measurement in advance —
so a configuration change alone will not beat it. Your score is a **bounded value in [0, 1]** that
grows with the logarithm of your speed-up over that baseline: **merely matching the baseline scores
0** — you have to beat it before you score at all — and the score is **capped at 1.0** once your
speed-up is large enough. Failing any correctness check, or touching the evaluation surface, also
scores 0. The exact calibration constant behind the curve is part of the evaluation surface and is
not disclosed. The verifier also reports, per case, what fraction of the GPU's measured peak HBM
bandwidth you achieved: that fraction is the physical ceiling for this workload, and the baseline is
nowhere near it.

Reaching a passing score is easy — the implementation shipped at
`/app/repo/submission/kv_traffic.py` is already correct. Getting close to the hardware bound is
very hard.

## Required API contract (frozen — the verifier calls exactly this)

Your implementation must live at **`/app/repo/submission/kv_traffic.py`** and expose a class
`KVTrafficEngine`. Everything your solution needs at scoring time must persist under
`/app/repo/submission/` (edits to installed site-packages alone may be lost when your work is
replayed); if you build a compiled extension, build it into `/app/repo/submission/` and load it
from there.

```

## Rules the verifier enforces (failing any of them scores 0)

1. **Bit-exact round-trip.** What `gather` returns must equal what was `scatter`-ed, **bit for
   bit**, and a page copied by `copy_pages` must read back bit-identically. This is data movement:
   there is no tolerance. Any lossy re-encoding (lower-precision storage, quantisation, dropping
   or summarising positions) fails. Lossless transformations are fine.
2. **Every output element is written.** Verifier-owned output buffers arrive poisoned; leaving any
   element unwritten is a failure, so you cannot skip part of the work.
3. **Nothing is aliased instead of stored.** The verifier overwrites the source buffers after a
   `scatter` and then reads the data back through `gather`.
4. **The current plan wins.** Two `begin_step` calls may arrive back to back; the second one
   defines what the following calls mean.
5. **Memory.** The verifier measures your allocation itself. What `allocate()` reserves must not
   exceed **1.10x** the nominal pool size
   (`2 * num_layers * num_pages * page_size * num_kv_heads * head_size * itemsize` bytes), and
   your peak allocation must stay within a small working allowance of it — so a second,
   differently-laid-out copy of the cache, or a staging buffer the size of the workload, will not
   fit.
6. **Shapes, dtypes and devices** exactly as specified above; no crashes.
7. Correctness is checked **first**, over hidden configurations that include awkward geometries
   (single pages, partial tail pages, unaligned starts, shuffled page order, shared pages,
   zero-length ranges, one-token writes, `page_size == 1`, several layers). It is a hard
   prerequisite: failing it scores 0 before any timing happens.

## Iterating

`python3 /app/dev_bench/run_dev_bench.py` runs your engine over a **public** development workload
set (different from the scored one), checks the round-trip, and prints each case's step time and
achieved bandwidth. Use it to iterate; faster there generally means a higher score, but the scored
workloads are not the same ones.

## Hard red line (any one of these makes the whole task score 0)

- Do **not** read, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, copy or edit any verifier, hidden-test or evaluation file
  (anything under `/tests`, `/opt/verifier`, `/opt/negative`), and do not try to infer their
  contents.
- Do **not** disable, kill or tamper with the timer daemon or the measurement path.
- Do **not** access the internet at runtime, and do not attempt to bypass the proxy isolation.

Solve it yourself. The upstream vLLM sources at `/app/repo`, the public literature on paged
attention and KV-cache management, and your own ideas are all fair game — what is forbidden is
touching the measurement.

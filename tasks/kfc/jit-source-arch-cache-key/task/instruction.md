# Performance Optimization Task

You are working on the work-reuse layer of a batch build service. The service receives
a stream of **build-specs**. Before running an expensive step for a spec, it computes a
short string **identity** for that spec and looks the identity up in a table of
already-produced identities; a hit means the prior artifact can be reused and the
expensive step is skipped. The file `identity_key.py` implements this identity as a
single function, `identity_key`. It is correct but produces far more distinct identities
than necessary.

## Behavioral contract

```python
def identity_key(spec: dict) -> str:
    ...
```

A **build-spec** is a mapping describing one build request:

- `"source"`: the source text — a string.
- `"target"`: the target-profile tag — a string. The produced artifact is specific to
  this profile.
- `"options"` (optional): a list of build-option tokens (strings). The list is an
  **unordered set** of options.
- `"toolchain"` (optional): the toolchain-version tag — a string.
- `"variants"` (optional): a list of requested variant names (strings), also an
  **unordered set**.
- `"build"` (optional): a mapping of incidental build annotations.

`identity_key(spec)` returns a **string**. It must be **deterministic and reproducible**:
the same spec (and any spec equivalent to it, see below) always yields the same string,
on every run and every machine — so derive it from the spec's content with a fixed rule,
not from anything process- or run-dependent.

### When are two build-specs equivalent?

Two specs are **equivalent** (they describe the same build and must receive the **same**
identity) when they are equal after applying **all** of the following normalizations. Any
difference that survives all of them makes the specs **distinct**, and distinct specs
must receive **different** identities.

1. **Incidental build annotations are ignored.** The `"build"` mapping never affects the
   identity — two specs that differ only in `"build"` (or in whether `"build"` is present
   at all) are equivalent.
2. **Field order is irrelevant.** The order in which the keys of any mapping are written
   does not matter.
3. **Source comments and whitespace are ignored.** Within `"source"`, line comments
   (`// …` to end of line) and block comments (`/* … */`) carry no meaning, and runs of
   whitespace are insignificant (any run of spaces/tabs/newlines is equivalent to a
   single space; leading and trailing whitespace is insignificant). Two source texts that
   are equal after removing comments and collapsing whitespace are equivalent. **Every
   other difference in the source text is meaningful.**
4. **Options are an unordered set with no-op defaults folded.** The order of `"options"`
   does not matter, and duplicate tokens are redundant. The tokens `"o0"`, `"dbgoff"`,
   and `"std0"` are **no-op defaults**: each is equivalent to the token being absent. Any
   **other** option token is meaningful and must be kept.
5. **Requested variants are an unordered set.** The order of `"variants"` does not matter
   and duplicates are redundant, but **which** variant names are present is meaningful.

Everything not listed above is **meaningful**: the source text (beyond comments and
whitespace), the target-profile tag, each effective (non-default) option token, the
toolchain-version tag, and the set of requested variant names. Specs that differ in any of
these are **distinct** and must not share an identity.

## Why the current implementation is wasteful

The current code derives the identity from the spec almost verbatim: it only neutralizes
the order of a mapping's keys. So two specs that are equivalent but merely spelled
differently — the same source with a comment added or reflowed whitespace, the same
options in a different order or with a no-op default written out, a stray build
annotation, the same variants listed in a different order — are treated as **different**
identities. The reuse table then holds one entry per spelling instead of one entry per
genuinely distinct build, and the expensive step is repeated for every spelling of the
same build.

Make the identity **collapse the equivalent spellings** so that equivalent specs map to
one identity and the reuse table holds as few entries as there are genuinely distinct
builds — while **never** giving two genuinely different specs the same identity.

## Correctness comes first

A single **collision between two genuinely different specs** — for example treating two
different target profiles, two different source texts, two different effective option
values, two different toolchain tags, or two different variant sets as the same — is a
hard failure and scores **zero**, no matter how few identities you produce. In
particular, two specs that share everything but the **target profile** describe different
artifacts and must never collide. Merging spellings that are only *incidentally* different
is the goal; merging builds that are *actually* different is never allowed. The verifier
checks both a suite of correctness cases and, over the whole workload, that no identity is
shared by two genuinely different builds.

## Forbidden

Do **not** import a tensor / graph / array framework, and do **not** import or read the
test harness or its workload. Compute the identity yourself from the spec content using
the standard library only. The scoring harness scans your submitted file for those
references and scores the task `0` (do not reference them even in comments).

## Scope

Optimize the product implementation in `identity_key.py` only. Do **not** edit tests,
harnesses, workloads, or dependency/build files. The final submitted diff must contain
only product-code changes. Public/dev feedback, when present, is representative only;
final verification runs additional trusted and hidden workloads.

## How this task is scored — ONE single submission (READ CAREFULLY)

You get **exactly one** submission. There is no iterative loop, no budget of
retries, and no per-round feedback to improve against: the moment you submit, the
task is over.

1. Read and profile the current implementation in `/app/repo/identity_key.py`, work out
   what is slow, and make it faster — taking as long as you need. Test your work
   yourself as much as you like *before* submitting: write your own scratch
   benchmarks and your own correctness checks in a scratch directory you create.
2. When — and only when — you are confident the solution is both correct and as
   fast as you can make it, submit it **once**:

   ```
   bash /opt/loop/submit.sh
   ```

3. **Submitting ends the task.** That single call scores the current state of
   `/app/repo`, records it as your final answer, and finalizes immediately. You
   will not get a second attempt, and you will not get feedback you could iterate
   on. A second call to `submit.sh` is refused.

Because there is no second chance, spend your effort *before* the submission:
convince yourself the contract holds on every case you can think of (the shapes,
dtypes, boundary and error cases described above), and verify your own timing
shows a real improvement over the shipped implementation. A fast but incorrect
submission scores zero, and there is no round in which to repair it.

The grade is produced by a full, trusted end-of-session verifier over more
workloads than anything you can see, so make the one submission you have a
genuinely correct one.

## 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these makes the whole task score 0)

The scoring machinery is off-limits. Solve this task **independently**, using
ONLY the code in `/app/repo` and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`, `find`, or edit
  ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test file or directory,
  wherever it may live. Running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is the ONLY sanctioned
  interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run any verifier directly or try to reproduce or reverse-engineer it
  — score ONLY by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds, thresholds,
  the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up the source PR, the upstream repository, or a
  reference solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the
  source), whether the internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring / source
  material, however you might have come to see it.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you create yourself.

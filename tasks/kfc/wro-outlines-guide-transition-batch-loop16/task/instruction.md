# Performance Optimization Task

## Scope

You may modify **only** this file:

```
guide_transition.py
```

Everything else is **out of scope**. Any change to a file outside the scope above
causes the submission to score zero. Find where the slowness is *inside the scope*
by reading and profiling the code — that is part of the task.

## Objective

`guide_transition.py` implements the **batched guide-state advance** step of
regex-constrained (guided) decoding. At every decode step the runtime holds one FSM/DFA
guide state per active sequence in the batch; after the sampler picks a token for each
sequence, the guide must advance every sequence's state along the transition its sampled
token induces, and it also needs the advanced state's out-degree (how many tokens are
still valid) to flag sequences that have reached a dead/terminal state.

The current implementation is **functionally correct but slow**: it never builds an
index. For **each** query it linear-scans the entire transition edge list to find the
matching `(state, token)` transition, then linear-scans the entire edge list **again** to
count the out-degree of the landed state. The cost is O(#queries × #edges).

Your job: **make `batch_advance` faster on the benchmark workload while producing the
same result.** You may reorganize the logic within the scope file however you like
(e.g. index the edge list once, then answer each query in O(1)), as long as the
observable output below is preserved.

## Behavioral contract (what the grader checks)

The grader calls the public entry point:

```python
batch_advance(num_states, edges, queries) -> dict
```

- `num_states`: number of DFA states (ids `0..num_states-1`);
- `edges`: the transition edge list — `(state, token_key, next_state)` triples of a
  deterministic automaton (at most one edge per `(state, token_key)`);
- `queries`: the batch — `(current_state, token_key)` pairs, one per active sequence.

The returned `dict` must contain exactly these keys, each equal to the independent
reference the grader computes:

1. `"next_states"`: `list[int]` — for each query, the advanced state, or `-1` if the
   token is not accepted from the current state (the sequence dies);
2. `"out_degrees"`: `list[int]` — for each query, the number of outgoing edges from the
   corresponding `next_states` entry (`0` for a dead query).

Both lists must match the reference exactly, in query order. A shortcut that advances by
the current state alone (ignoring the sampled token) is wrong whenever a state has edges
on multiple tokens and scores zero. The public signature must remain unchanged.

The reward increases as the wall-clock time of `batch_advance` decreases on the benchmark
workload, subject to the correctness requirement above. A correct submission that changes
nothing scores about 1.0.

## Notes

- The workload runs on CPU; no GPU is required. Only `numpy` and the Python standard
  library are available (the scope itself is pure Python).
- Determinism: given the same inputs, your implementation must produce the same output
  on every run.

## Solve independently — prohibited actions (any one ⇒ the whole task scores 0)

- Reading, printing, copying, `cat`/`grep`/`find`-ing, editing, or reproducing ANY
  verifier / scoring / hidden-test / golden file, wherever it lives; or inferring
  hidden inputs/thresholds.
- Downloading or cloning the upstream project or looking up its reference
  implementation in ANY form — `git clone`/`fetch`/`pull`, adding a git remote,
  `pip download`/`pip install` of the same package, `wget`/`curl` of upstream files,
  checking out a different commit, or web lookup — whether the network appears to work
  or not.
- Bypassing or disabling the network isolation (unsetting/overriding
  `http_proxy`/`https_proxy`/`all_proxy`, opening raw sockets, or any other
  circumvention).

## How you are scored (ONE single graded submission)

- You get **exactly one** graded submission. Submit it with
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- **Submitting ends the task.** The moment `submit.sh` returns you are done: stop
  editing and stop working on this task.
- A second call to `submit.sh` is **refused** and exits non-zero. There is no
  retry, no budget of attempts, no "best of several submissions", and no separate
  finalization step — your one submission *is* the final answer.
- You will **not** get iterative feedback to improve against. Nothing is measured
  for you round by round, so there is no measured signal to chase.
- Whatever state the in-scope file is in when you submit is exactly what gets
  graded. Nothing is restored, re-selected or rolled back for you.
- Therefore: read the code, settle the design, and **self-test thoroughly with
  your own scratch scripts** before you submit. Correctness is a hard gate — a
  fast but incorrect submission scores **zero**.
- Explain your approach and your reasoning in writing before you submit.

## 提交方式

本题只有**一次**评分提交(kfc 全子集单次)。改完后运行一次 `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`:它给当前 `/app/repo` 评分并**立即定稿**(无需再单独调 `--finalize`,也没有第二次机会 —— 再次调用只会重新定稿同一份已记录的最佳快照,不给新改动评分)。请先用你自己的脚本充分自测再提交。
改动留在工作树里,不需要 `git commit`(判分读工作树,仓库 HEAD 必须停在初始基线 commit 上)。

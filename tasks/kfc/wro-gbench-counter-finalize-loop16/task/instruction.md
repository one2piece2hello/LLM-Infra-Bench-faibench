Optimize the per-counter finalization used by a microbenchmark harness.

## Context

A microbenchmark records, for every benchmark case, a set of user counters. Each
counter carries a raw accumulated value plus a bitmask of flags describing how the
raw value must be finalized once the run's `iterations`, `cpu_time` (seconds) and
`num_threads` are known. This mirrors Google Benchmark's `Finish`
(`src/counter.cc`) together with the flag semantics in
`include/benchmark/counter.h`.

The scope file `/app/repo/bench_counter.py` implements
`finalize_counters(values, flags, iterations, cpu_time, num_threads)` over a whole
run's `(B, C)` counter table (`B` benchmarks, `C` counters). It is functionally
correct but slow: it walks every `(benchmark, counter)` cell in a Python loop,
reads each raw value out of the numpy table one element at a time, and applies the
five flag transforms with scalar Python branches. Once `B * C` grows, that
interpreted per-cell finalization dominates.

## Task

Make `finalize_counters` fast while keeping its behaviour **exactly**. Only edit
`/app/repo/bench_counter.py`.

The behavioural contract (checked against an independent reference) — each
counter's raw value `v` is transformed in this FIXED order (per-benchmark
`cpu_time`, `num_threads`, `iterations` broadcast across that benchmark's
counters), returning a `float64` array of shape `(B, C)`:

  * `kIsRate` (`1 << 0`):               `v /= cpu_time`
  * `kAvgThreads` (`1 << 1`):           `v /= num_threads`
  * `kIsIterationInvariant` (`1 << 2`): `v *= iterations`
  * `kAvgIterations` (`1 << 3`):        `v /= iterations`
  * `kInvert` (`1 << 31`):              `v = 1.0 / v`  — applied **last**, always.

Inputs must not be mutated. The expected direction is to replace the per-cell
Python loop with vectorized array operations — boolean masks built from the flag
bits plus `numpy.where` for each transform, with the per-benchmark scalars
broadcast across the counter axis. The order of the transforms (in particular that
the inversion is applied last) must be preserved exactly.

## How you are scored

You get **exactly one** graded submission (`bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`) — submitting ends the task
and a second call is refused. The reward is a log-curve function of the wall-clock **speedup** of
the benchmark workload against the frozen slow baseline that ships in this repository, in `[0, 1]`:
matching the reference (oracle) implementation's speed scores **0.5**, being as far past it again
as it is past the baseline caps the reward at **1.0**, and merely matching the baseline scores
**0.0**. It is **gated on exact correctness** — a single mismatched finalized value scores 0
regardless of speed. Think the change through and self-test before you submit; you cannot iterate.

## Anti-cheat red line (A-only)

Reading or tampering with the verifier/scoring assets, reproducing or importing
the hidden harness, fetching the upstream repository/reference implementation, or
bypassing the runtime network isolation — any of these makes the WHOLE task score
zero. Solve it by editing the scope file only.

## 提交方式

本题只有**一次**评分提交(kfc 全子集单次)。改完后运行一次 `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`:它给当前 `/app/repo` 评分并**立即定稿**(无需再单独调 `--finalize`,也没有第二次机会 —— 再次调用只会重新定稿同一份已记录的最佳快照,不给新改动评分)。请先用你自己的脚本充分自测再提交。
改动留在工作树里,不需要 `git commit`(判分读工作树,仓库 HEAD 必须停在初始基线 commit 上)。

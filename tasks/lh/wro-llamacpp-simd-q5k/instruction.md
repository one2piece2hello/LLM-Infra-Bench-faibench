# Performance Optimization Task

## What you are given

A frozen checkpoint of a CPU inference library at `/app/repo` (the `ggml`
tensor library used by `llama.cpp` for on-device / edge inference). The
matrix-multiply inner loop dot-products a 5-bit K-quant (`Q5_K`) weight row against its paired
activation row. The x86 implementation of this hot kernel, `ggml_vec_dot_q5_K_q8_K` in

```
ggml/src/ggml-cpu/arch/x86/quants.c
```

currently delegates to a plain scalar reference: for every 256-element super-block it reconstructs each 5-bit weight (four low bits from `qs`, one high bit from `qh`), unpacks the 6-bit per-sub-block scale and min from the packed `scales`, forms `d·scale·Σ(q5·q8) − dmin·min·Σ(q8)` and accumulates. It is correct but slow.
Your job is to make this dot-product faster **without changing its numerical result**.

## Editable scope (out-of-scope edits fail the task)

You may modify **only**:

```
ggml/src/ggml-cpu/arch/x86/quants.c
```

Any change to a compiled source file outside this scope causes the submission to
score 0. Your edited file is recompiled into `libggml-cpu.a` and linked into the
benchmark on every submission.

## The entry-point contract (must stay behavior-identical)

The exported symbol

```c
void ggml_vec_dot_q5_K_q8_K(int n, float *s, size_t bs,
                            const void *vx, size_t bx,
                            const void *vy, size_t by, int nrc);
```

must keep its signature and its result: given `n` elements laid out as `n/256` consecutive `block_q5_K` (`{ ggml_half d, dmin; uint8_t scales[12]; uint8_t qh[32]; uint8_t qs[128]; }`)
weight super-blocks and `block_q8_K` (`{ float d; int8_t qs[256]; int16_t bsums[16]; }`) activation super-blocks,
it must write into `*s` the same dot product the scalar reference produces. The
verifier feeds a fixed, deterministic block and requires the exact reference dot
**2304.0**; any implementation that changes this value scores 0.

## What is measured

The verifier recompiles your `quants.c`, links the kernel, and times it on many
random Q5_K×Q8_K blocks, rewarding **wall-clock speedup over the provided slow
scalar baseline**, on the condition that the deterministic reference dot above is
reproduced exactly. Bigger, correct speedups score higher. The CPU exposes the
usual x86 SIMD extensions (SSE4.2 / AVX / AVX2 / FMA / F16C); a vectorized 5-bit K-quant dot — inject the high-bit plane from `qh`, mask the 4-bit low weights into SIMD lanes, unpack the packed 6-bit scales/mins, fold the min correction through the `bsums`, and fuse a multiply-add accumulate recovers
most of the headroom. Headroom grows with block count.

## Rules

- Change only the file(s) in **Editable scope**. Keep the exported symbol and its
  numerical result identical; only the internal implementation may change.
- The starting implementation is correct — do not "fix correctness", make it FAST
  while staying correct.
- Do not special-case the verifier's inputs; the kernel must stay a general
  Q5_K×Q8_K dot product.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** `/app/repo/ggml/src/ggml-cpu/arch/x86/quants.c` — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** route around the task: do not hardcode or special-case the verifier's reference value(s) or its fixed inputs, and do not copy, port, or adapt another quantization kernel's dot-product routine into your file — derive the `Q5_K` 5-bit unpack and per-block dequant yourself so the kernel stays a general `Q5_K×Q8_K` dot product.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

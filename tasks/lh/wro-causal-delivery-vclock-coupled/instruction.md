# Performance Optimization Task

## Objective
This repository powers the delivery layer of a causal-broadcast messaging system. In causal delivery,
a receiver must present messages to the application in an order consistent with the happens-before
relation: a message may only be delivered once every message that causally precedes it has already
been delivered. Messages that arrive out of order are buffered until they become deliverable. The
implementation under `causal/` is functionally correct but **slow** when many messages arrive out of
order. Make
it **faster** on the benchmark workloads while preserving its exact observable behavior. Finding
*where* and *why* it is slow, by reading and profiling the code inside the scope, is part of the task.

## Editable scope
You may modify **only** these files (any edit outside them scores zero):
```
causal/buffer.py
causal/channel.py
```
Everything else under `/app/repo` is out of scope and read-only — in particular `causal/vclock.py`
defines the vector clock and the happens-before partial order your results are specified against.

## Driven subsystem and contract
A vector clock (`causal.vclock.VectorClock`) maps `pid -> int` (missing = 0). A message is
`(msg_id, sender_pid, vc)`; `vc` is the sender's clock after its own tick, so `vc[sender] =
D_sender[sender] + 1`. Against a receiver's delivered-clock `D`, a message is **deliverable** iff
`vc[sender] == D[sender] + 1` and `vc[k] <= D[k]` for every `k != sender`. Treat `vclock.py` as a
fixed contract.

`CausalChannel()` — the delivery driver; these must hold **exactly**:
- `deliver(msg)` where `msg = (msg_id, sender_pid, vc_dict)` -> the list of `msg_id`s delivered as a
  result of this arrival, in delivery order. Buffering an out-of-order message returns `[]`; a message
  that unblocks a chain returns several ids. When several buffered messages are simultaneously
  deliverable, the smallest `msg_id` is delivered first (deterministic tie-break). Delivering a
  message advances `D[sender]` by 1.
- `delivered_ids()` -> the full delivery order so far.
- `pending_count()` -> number of currently buffered (undelivered) messages.
- `clock()` -> the current delivered-clock as a dict of nonzero entries.

`PendingStore` in `buffer.py` is the buffer the channel builds on; you may change its interface as
long as `CausalChannel`'s observable behavior above is preserved.

Preserve the class/method names and signatures of `CausalChannel`, and the results above for every
input — in-order, fully reversed, interleaved senders, single sender, concurrent messages, and deep
dependency chains.

## Workload shape
The benchmark feeds a large stream in which messages arrive out of order (so they buffer, then
cascade-deliver), and times it; correctness is checked over many diverse arrival interleavings against
an independent in-harness reference. A hidden set covers more cases. No model weights, GPU, or network
are involved — this is host-side logic.

## Rules
- Preserve `CausalChannel`'s class/method names, signatures, and the exact observable behavior above.
- Do not read/run/reproduce/infer the scoring/verifier code, hidden workloads, thresholds, or any
  reference solution.
- Do not download/clone/fetch the upstream project or any external reference, and do not bypass the
  network isolation. Any such action scores zero.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** `/app/repo/causal/buffer.py` and/or `/app/repo/causal/channel.py` — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** route around the task by importing or calling a prebuilt equivalent of the function you are asked to implement; build the computation yourself in the scope file.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

## 提交方式

会话内用 `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` 自评并拿反馈,完成后 `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize`。
改动留在工作树里,不需要 `git commit`。

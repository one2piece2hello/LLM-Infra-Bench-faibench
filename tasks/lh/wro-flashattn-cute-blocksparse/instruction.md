# Performance Optimization Task

## Objective
A subsystem in this repository computes a **block-sparse multi-head attention forward
pass**: given query, key, and value tensors and a description of which pairs of
`(query-block, key-block)` are permitted, it produces — for every query position — the
softmax-weighted combination of the values according to the scaled query-key dot products,
but restricted so that each query position can only attend to key positions that lie
inside one of the permitted blocks. It is functionally correct but **slow**. Make it
**faster** on the benchmark workloads while preserving its numerical behavior (outputs
within tolerance of the reference). Finding *where* and *why* it is slow, by reading and
profiling the code inside the scope, is part of the task.

## Editable scope
You may modify **only** this file (any edit outside it scores zero):
```
flash_attn/cute/interface.py
```
Everything else under `/app/repo` is out of scope.

## Entry point and contract
The verifier drives the subsystem through the public entry point
`flash_attn.cute.flash_attn_func(q, k, v, softmax_scale=..., block_sparse_tensors=...)`
(`causal=False` and no window / softcap / sink / score_mod / mask_mod arguments — the
block-sparse tensors are the sole masking mechanism on the benchmark cases):

- `q`: `(batch, seqlen_q, num_heads_q, head_dim)` query tensor (fp16 or bf16).
- `k`, `v`: `(batch, seqlen_k, num_heads_kv, head_dim)` key / value tensors (same dtype
  as `q`). `num_heads_q` is an integer multiple of `num_heads_kv` (grouped-query
  attention; each key/value head is shared by `num_heads_q // num_heads_kv` consecutive
  query heads). `seqlen_q` and `seqlen_k` may differ (cross-attention).
- `softmax_scale` (float or None): the multiplier applied to the query-key dot products
  before the softmax; when `None` it defaults to `1 / sqrt(head_dim)`.
- `block_sparse_tensors`: an instance of
  `flash_attn.cute.block_sparsity.BlockSparseTensorsTorch` with these fields (only the
  ones relevant to this task are described here — the rest default to `None`):
    - `mask_block_cnt`: `int32` tensor, shape `(1, 1, num_m_blocks)`, giving the count of
      "partial/boundary" key-blocks per query-block. On the benchmark cases this is
      **zero everywhere** (no partial blocks — each permitted block is fully covered);
      the field is still passed to satisfy the API.
    - `mask_block_idx`: `int32` tensor, shape `(1, 1, num_m_blocks, 1)`, dummy since
      `mask_block_cnt` is all zero.
    - `full_block_cnt`: `int32` tensor, shape `(1, 1, num_m_blocks)`, giving the number
      of permitted key-blocks per query-block.
    - `full_block_idx`: `int32` tensor, shape `(1, 1, num_m_blocks, max_full_per_row)`,
      giving — for each query-block `m` — the key-block indices (in `[0, num_n_blocks)`)
      it is allowed to attend to; only the first `full_block_cnt[..., m]` entries per row
      are valid.
    - `block_size`: a `(block_q, block_kv)` tuple with the query-block size (rows of the
      partition) and key-block size (columns).
  Let `num_m_blocks = ceil(seqlen_q / block_q)` and
  `num_n_blocks = ceil(seqlen_k / block_kv)`. The allowed positions for a query row `i`
  are the union — over the first `full_block_cnt[0, 0, m]` entries of
  `full_block_idx[0, 0, m, :]` (where `m = i // block_q`) — of the key ranges
  `[n * block_kv, min((n + 1) * block_kv, seqlen_k))`.
- returns: the attention output `o` with shape `(batch, seqlen_q, num_heads_q, head_dim)`
  and the same dtype as `q`. (The entry also accepts other optional arguments; the
  benchmark only exercises the arguments described above and leaves the rest at their
  defaults.)

For each query position the result is `sum_j softmax_j( scale * (q · k_j) ) * v_j`
taken over the set of key positions `j` allowed by the block-sparse partition described
by `block_sparse_tensors`. A query whose allowed set is empty produces a zero output
vector. The returned output must match the reference within a **3% relative L2**
tolerance (and an 8% relative max-abs bound) on each hidden case. Preserve the entry
point's signature and this behavior.

## Workload shape
Correctness is checked over many hidden cases spanning different batch sizes, sequence
lengths (including `seqlen_q != seqlen_k`), query/key-value head counts (including
grouped-query), head dimensions, block-partition parameters (both `block_q` and
`block_kv` are always `128` on the benchmark; the count of allowed blocks per query
row varies), half-precision dtypes, and softmax scales. The timing workload runs one
forward over a single long-sequence sparsely-connected batch.

## Rules
- Preserve the entry point's signature and numerical behavior (within tolerance),
  including the `block_sparse_tensors` allow-set restriction, the grouped-query head
  sharing, and the `softmax_scale` semantics.
- **Implement the forward yourself within the scope file.** Do not import or call an
  external / prebuilt / compiled attention implementation to stand in for it (the
  submitted file may not add references to `scaled_dot_product_attention`,
  `flash_attn_2_cuda` / `flash_attn_3_cuda`, the compiled `flash_attn_interface`,
  `xformers`, `sageattention`, or `vllm` — including inside comments). Any such
  occurrence scores zero.
- Do not read/run/reproduce/infer the scoring/verifier code, hidden workloads,
  thresholds, or any reference solution.
- Do not download/clone/fetch the upstream project or any external reference, and do
  not bypass the network isolation. Any such action scores zero.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** `/app/repo/flash_attn/cute/interface.py` — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** call or reference the banned prebuilt/external attention primitives (`scaled_dot_product_attention`, `flash_attn_2_cuda`, `flash_attn_3_cuda`, `xformers`, `sageattention`, `vllm`, the compiled `flash_attn_interface`) anywhere in your submitted file — the verifier scans your file textually for these tokens and scores the task 0 on a hit; do not even name them in comments.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

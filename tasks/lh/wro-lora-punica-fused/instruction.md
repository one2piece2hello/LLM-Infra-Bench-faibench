# Performance Optimization Task

## Objective
A multi-LoRA batched apply subsystem (the shrink → expand path) in this repository is
functionally correct but slow. Make it **faster** on the benchmark workloads while
**preserving its numerical behavior** (outputs within a **2% relative tolerance**;
fp16 inputs, fp32 accumulation). All work must stay inside the declared editable scope.

## Editable scope
Edit **only** these three files (edits outside this scope score the submission zero):
```
vllm/lora/ops/triton_ops/kernel_utils.py
vllm/lora/ops/triton_ops/lora_shrink_op.py
vllm/lora/ops/triton_ops/lora_expand_op.py
```

## Entry points and contract
Two registered ops drive the subsystem:
- `lora_shrink(inputs, lora_a_weights, output_tensor, token_lora_mapping, token_indices_sorted_by_lora_ids, num_tokens_per_lora, lora_token_start_loc, lora_ids, no_lora_flag_cpu, scaling)` — for each token, projects it through its assigned LoRA's A matrix (scaled). `output_tensor` `[num_slices, num_tokens, rank]` is written in place.
- `lora_expand(inputs, lora_b_weights, output_tensor, ...same routing..., offset_start=0, add_inputs=False)` — projects the shrunk buffer through the LoRA's B matrix into the output slice region (adding when `add_inputs`). `output_tensor` `[num_tokens, sum-of-slice-out-sizes]` is written in place.
- Each token carries a LoRA id via `token_lora_mapping` (`-1` = no LoRA); the routing tensors group tokens by LoRA id. `lora_a_weights[s]`: `[num_loras, rank, hidden]`; `lora_b_weights[s]`: `[num_loras, out, rank]`.

**Correctness requirement.** For every benchmark input, the outputs must match the
reference LoRA result within a **2% relative tolerance**. Any change altering the
result beyond that tolerance scores zero.

## Workload shape
The benchmark drives batched multi-LoRA application: thousands of tokens each routed
to one of several LoRA adapters, small adapter rank, shrink then expand. A hidden set
covers additional shapes.

## Rules
- Preserve the ops' signatures and behavior (within tolerance).
- Do **not** read, run, reproduce, or infer the scoring/verifier code, hidden test
  workloads, thresholds, or any reference solution.
- Do **not** download, clone, fetch, or otherwise obtain the upstream project, its
  history, or any external reference implementation, and do **not** bypass or disable
  the network isolation. Solve from the code present. Any such action scores the whole task zero.
- Write the optimization **in these three files**, using the libraries they already
  import (PyTorch / Triton). Do **not** copy or recover an implementation from any other
  copy of this package inside the container (for example an installed
  `site-packages`/`dist-packages` copy, a version-control object store, or another module
  of the repository), and do **not** load code from outside the declared scope at run time
  (`importlib`, `spec_from_file_location`, `exec`, or shelling out via
  `subprocess`/`os.system`/`os.popen`). A submission whose in-scope code does any of this
  scores zero.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** one of the in-scope files (`/app/repo/vllm/lora/ops/triton_ops/kernel_utils.py`, `/app/repo/vllm/lora/ops/triton_ops/lora_shrink_op.py`, `/app/repo/vllm/lora/ops/triton_ops/lora_expand_op.py`) — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** call or reference the banned route-around tokens (`site-packages`, `dist-packages`, `importlib`, `spec_from_file_location`, `import_module`, `subprocess`, `os.system`, `os.popen`, `exec(`, `.git/`, `gated_gelu`, `ops.torch_ops`, `ops.xla_ops`) anywhere in your submitted code — the verifier scans your three scope files textually for these tokens and scores the task 0 on a hit. Build the shrink/expand path yourself, inside the scope files, from the code already present; do not dynamically load or copy an implementation from anywhere else in the container.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

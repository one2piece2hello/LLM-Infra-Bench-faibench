# Optimize a group-quantised int8-weight / fp16-activation matmul subsystem

## Objective

`w8a16` provides a single public operation, `w8a16_matmul(a, qweight, scales, zeros,
group_size)`, which returns `a @ dequant(qweight, scales, zeros, group_size)` for a
half-precision activation and an **asymmetric group-quantised** int8 weight. Asymmetric group
quantisation means consecutive blocks of `group_size` rows along the `K` dimension share one
`(scale, zero-point)` pair per output column `n`; a stored int8 weight is recovered by removing
its group's integer zero-point and then applying its group's scale. The result is `a @ W` reduced
with an fp32 accumulator and returned as `torch.float16`.

The current implementation is **functionally correct but slow**. Your job is to make
`w8a16_matmul` **as fast as possible on the benchmark workload** while preserving its public
signature and numerical contract exactly. The reference result is the fp32 product of the
activation and the fully dequantised weight; your output must match it within the harness
tolerance across a range of shapes.

## Editable scope

You may edit **only** this file:

```
w8a16/matmul.py
```

Any change to files outside this scope causes the whole task to score zero. The public
entry point `w8a16_matmul(a, qweight, scales, zeros, group_size)` and its input/output
contract must remain unchanged:

- `a`: `torch.float16`, shape `[M, K]`, CUDA (the activation).
- `qweight`: `torch.int8`, shape `[K, N]`, CUDA (asymmetric group-quantised weight).
- `scales`: `torch.float16`, shape `[K // group_size, N]`, CUDA (one scale per
  `(group, column)`).
- `zeros`: `torch.int8`, shape `[K // group_size, N]`, CUDA (one integer zero-point per
  `(group, column)`).
- `group_size`: a positive `int` that divides `K`.
- returns: `torch.float16`, shape `[M, N]`, CUDA, equal to the activation times the dequantised
  weight described above, computed with an fp32 accumulator.
- `M`, `K`, `N` are arbitrary positive integers (not necessarily powers of two or
  multiples of any particular size); `group_size` divides `K`. The operation must be
  correct for all of them.

## What is measured

- **Correctness** (hard gate): the operation's output must match the independent fp32
  reference within a relative-norm tolerance, over a hidden suite of diverse shapes and
  group sizes (small, large, rectangular, ragged, non-power-of-two, few-groups,
  many-groups). Every output element must apply the correct per-group scale and subtract
  the correct per-group integer zero-point. The fraction of shapes that pass is graded;
  an implementation that is correct only for one specific shape or group size scores
  partially. Full performance credit requires passing every shape.
- **Performance** (reward): wall-clock speedup of your implementation over the frozen
  baseline currently in `w8a16/matmul.py`, measured on a hidden small-`M`, large-`K`/`N`
  fp16 workload with warmup and repeated timed iterations. Higher is better.

## Rules (A-only red line)

Solve the task **only** by improving the implementation inside the editable scope. The
following cause the whole task to score zero:

- reading, importing, copying, or reconstructing the hidden verifier, reward script, or
  timing harness, or hard-coding to their internals;
- fetching or reusing any external/upstream implementation of this operation, or
  otherwise obtaining the answer rather than deriving it;
- routing the computation to a prebuilt library matmul (e.g. `torch.matmul`, `torch.mm`,
  `F.linear`, cuBLAS/CUTLASS bindings, the `@` operator) instead of computing the
  product in your own implementation;
- editing anything outside the declared scope, or weakening/bypassing the correctness
  check;
- attempting to detect the grading mode or bypass the runtime isolation.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** `/app/repo/w8a16/matmul.py` — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** call or reference the banned primitives (`torch.matmul`, `torch.mm`, `torch.bmm`, `F.linear`, `torch.nn.functional.linear`, `torch.einsum`, `cublas`, `cutlass`, `addmm`, `.matmul(`, `torch._int_mm`, `_weight_int8pack_mm`, `_scaled_mm`, `torch.ops.aten`) anywhere in your submitted file — the verifier scans your file textually for these tokens and scores the task 0 on a hit; do not even name them in comments.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

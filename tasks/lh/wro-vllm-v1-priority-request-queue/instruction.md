# Performance Optimization Task

## Objective
A subsystem is the vLLM V1 scheduler **priority request queue** (serve ascending (priority, arrival_time, insertion-seq)). It is backed by an UNSORTED list: O(1) add but an O(n) linear min-scan on every peek/pop (draining n requests is O(n^2)).
It is functionally correct but **slow**. Make it **faster** on the benchmark workloads while
preserving its behavior (outputs within tolerance of the reference / exact decision trace).
Finding *where* and *why* it is slow, by reading and profiling the code inside the scope, is part
of the task.

## Editable scope
You may modify **only** this file (any edit outside it scores zero):
```
vllm/v1/core/sched/wro_priority_request_queue.py
```
Everything else under `/app/repo` is out of scope.

## Entry point and contract
The verifier drives `PriorityRequestQueue` via add_request / peek_request / pop_request / remove_request, using a duck-typed request stub exposing `.priority` and `.arrival_time`.

- The pop/serve ORDER contract (ascending priority, then arrival_time, then FIFO insertion order) is the correctness spec and must be preserved exactly.
- The internal representation is an implementation detail: you may replace it entirely, as long as every public method keeps its signature and the ORDER contract above holds for every possible interleaving of add/peek/pop/remove.

## Scoring
Correctness is a hard gate (exact pop-order trace equality over 20 diverse add/pop/remove scenarios vs an independent reference). Once fully correct, the reward rises with the speedup
of your implementation relative to the reference optimized version (the oracle); matching the
oracle scores ~1.0 and beating it scores higher. A correct-but-unoptimized submission scores ~0.5.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** `/app/repo/vllm/v1/core/sched/wro_priority_request_queue.py` — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** call or reference the banned primitives (`import cachetools`, `from cachetools`, `import sortedcontainers`, `from sortedcontainers`, `import queue`, `PriorityQueue`, `import blist`, `import pyheapq`) anywhere in your submitted file — the verifier scans your file textually for these tokens and scores the task 0 on a hit; do not even name them in comments.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

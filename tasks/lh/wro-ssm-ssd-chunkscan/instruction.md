# Performance Optimization Task

## Objective

A state-space-model (SSM) sequence-scan subsystem in this repository is
functionally correct but slow. Your task is to **make it faster** on the
benchmark workloads while **preserving its numerical behavior** within the
tolerance stated below. All of your work must stay inside the declared editable
scope.

## Editable scope

You may edit **only** these five files (everything else is out of scope; edits
outside this scope cause the submission to score zero):

```
vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_combined.py
vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_chunk_state.py
vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_state_passing.py
vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_chunk_scan.py
vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_bmm.py
```

Finding *where* the time goes inside this subsystem, and how to compute the same
result faster, is the task. You may add helper functions/kernels within these
files.

## Entry point and contract

The subsystem is driven through its public entry point:

```python
mamba_chunk_scan_combined(
    x, dt, A, B, C, chunk_size,
    D=None, z=None, dt_bias=None,
    dt_softplus=False, out=None, return_final_states=False,
)
```

with tensor shapes:

- `x`:  `(batch, seqlen, nheads, headdim)`
- `dt`: `(batch, seqlen, nheads)`
- `A`:  `(nheads,)`
- `B`, `C`: `(batch, seqlen, ngroups, dstate)`  (`nheads % ngroups == 0`)
- `D`:  `(nheads, headdim)` or `(nheads,)`; `z`: same shape as `x`
- `dt_bias`: `(nheads,)`; `chunk_size`: an integer power of two
- `out`: a preallocated output tensor of `x`'s shape that the call fills

**Correctness requirement.** For every benchmark input, the output written to
`out` must match the reference SSM-scan result within a **2% relative tolerance**
(bf16 inputs, fp32 accumulation; parity is judged by relative error, not exact match). Any change that alters the computed
result beyond this tolerance scores zero.

## Workload shape

The benchmark drives long-sequence **prefill scans**: a batch of sequences with
a multi-thousand `seqlen`, tens of heads, a per-head state dimension, grouped
`B`/`C` shared across heads, and a power-of-two `chunk_size`. Optimize for this
regime; the hidden benchmark also covers additional shapes.

## Rules

- Preserve the public entry point's signature and behavior (within tolerance).
- Do **not** attempt to read, run, reproduce, or infer the scoring/verifier
  code, the hidden test workloads, thresholds, or any reference solution.
- Do **not** download, clone, fetch, or otherwise obtain the upstream project,
  its history, or any external reference implementation, and do **not** bypass
  or disable the environment's network isolation. Solve the task from the code
  present in the workspace. Any such action scores the whole task zero.

## 🔁 Iterative submission protocol (this task uses a per-task loop)

### 1. Goal + protocol

Optimize the performance of *this* task as far as you can. You have a
**submission budget of 1 to 16**: you may submit as few as **1** time and at
most **16** (hard ceiling). There is no minimum beyond a single submission and
no requirement to keep going — finalize as soon as you judge your solution good
enough.

**Iterate ONE round at a time, feedback-driven.** Each round is a single cycle:

1. **Edit** one of the five in-scope files (`/app/repo/vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_combined.py`, `/app/repo/vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_chunk_state.py`, `/app/repo/vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_state_passing.py`, `/app/repo/vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_chunk_scan.py`, `/app/repo/vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/ops/ssd_bmm.py`) — apply ONE concrete change based on your current
   hypothesis (round 1: based on reading the baseline code).
2. **Submit** by running `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` **once** — it returns
   sanitized correctness + `dev_speedup` + `best_so_far` + `remaining` +
   `finalize_allowed` synchronously.
3. **Read the feedback in full.** If correctness FAIL, the named failing
   invariant is your fix target. If PASS, `dev_speedup` vs `best_so_far`
   tells you whether this round improved.
4. **Analyze in writing** — (a) what the feedback told you, (b) *why* this
   round's change had that effect (mechanistic reasoning), (c) *what specific
   single change* the next round will try.
5. **Edit again based on that analysis**, then go to step 2.

Do **NOT** call `submit.sh` in a batch; do **NOT** plan more than one attempt
ahead — round `k+1`'s plan must depend on round `k`'s measured outcome. Edit
only product code; never touch tests/benchmarks/workloads/build files.

If the feedback ever says `harness_error`, that submission was refunded and
the failure is NOT your code's fault — do not debug the harness; retry or
continue optimizing.

### 2. Termination

Two ways to end:

- (a) reach 16 submissions (auto-finalize triggers as a safety net); or
- (b) at any k with **1 ≤ k < 16**, once you believe you have reached your
  practical/theoretical limit (e.g. the last few submissions converged within
  run noise), run
  `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize --reason "<one concrete sentence on
  why you are stopping>"` — the reason is recorded and audited.

Early exit is a feature: you keep the best of your submissions, and a
*justified* stop scores exactly the same as burning all 16. You decide when to
stop; there is no minimum submission count.

### 3. 🔴 Red line (hard — ANY one of these ⇒ the whole task scores 0 in audit)

The scoring machinery is protected and off-limits. Solve this task
**independently**: rely ONLY on the code in `/app/repo`, the sanitized feedback
`submit` returns, and your own knowledge and reasoning.

- Do **NOT deliberately** read, `cat`, `open`, `less`, `head`/`tail`, `grep`,
  `find`, or edit ANY verifier / correctness / timing / scoring / hidden-test
  file or directory, wherever it lives. Executing `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` is
  the ONLY sanctioned interaction with the scoring machinery.
- Do **NOT** run the verifier directly or try to reproduce / reverse-engineer
  it — score **only** by calling `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh`.
- Do **NOT** search for, print, or infer the hidden workloads, seeds,
  thresholds, the metric name, or the reference speedup from any source.
- Do **NOT** fetch or look up an upstream implementation or a reference
  solution (no web search, no `git` remote fetch, no network to the source),
  whether internet is on or off.
- Do **NOT** use, quote, or condition your code on any verifier / scoring /
  source material, however you came to see it.
- Do **NOT** route around the task by importing or calling a prebuilt equivalent of the function you are asked to implement; build the computation yourself in the scope file.

Stay inside `/app/repo` and scratch directories you created yourself; use only
what `submit` returns for scoring signal.

### 4. 🎓 Explain for a beginner — per round, not in bulk

Before your first edit, explain your **approach** (the hypothesis round 1
tests). Then **after every `submit.sh` feedback — and BEFORE the next edit —**
give a step-by-step analysis: what the result told you, *why* the change had
that effect, and *what single change* you will try next, written so an
undergraduate can follow.

## 提交方式

会话内用 `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh` 自评并拿反馈,完成后 `bash /opt/loop/submit.sh --finalize`。
改动留在工作树里,不需要 `git commit`。
